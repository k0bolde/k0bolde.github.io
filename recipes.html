          Found this recipe in my mom's collection. Makes a lot more sugar cookie tasting cookie than my other recipe. Still chewy but a bit more crisp.<br>
          I use butter instead of shortening.<br>
          <br>
          Ingredients:<br>
          1 cup sugar<br>
          1 cup brown sugar<br>
          3/4 cup butter<br>
          3/4 cup peanut butter<br>
          2 eggs<br>
          2 tsp vanilla<br>
          3 cup flour<br>
          1 tsp baking soda<br>
          3/4 tsp salt<br>
          <br>
          Steps:<br>
          Mix wet ingredients together first, then add dry ingredients all at once.<br>
          Smush with a fork to get the classic peanut butter cookie look.<br>
          Bake at 350 degrees for 9 - 11 minutes.<br>

          The family ginger cookies recipes, no idea what its from but its called ginger.txt and has my parent's names
          typed out.<br>
          It says to use shortening so they're chewy, but I've made them with butter and they're about the same.<br>
          <br>
          Ingredients:<br>
          4 1/2 cups flour<br>
          4 tsp ginger<br>
          2 tsp baking soda<br>
          1 1/2 tsp cinnamon<br>
          1 tsp ground cloves<br>
          1/4 tsp salt<br>
          1 1/2 cups butter or shortening<br>
          2 cups sugar<br>
          2 eggs<br>
          1/2 cup molasses<br>
          3/4 cup+ sugar for coating<br>
          <br>
          Things to try:<br>
          Replace sugar with brown sugar?<br>
          Chocolate chips?<br>
          1 tsp nutmeg? allspice?<br>
          <br>
          Steps:<br>
          1. Stir the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt together in a mixing bowl.<br>
          2. In another mixing bowl, beat the butter/shortening until it's soft. Or melted butter if you're lazy.<br>
          3. Add the sugar and beat until "fluffy".<br>
          4. Add eggs and molasses, beat well.<br>
          5. Add half the flour mixture, beat until combined.<br>
          6. Stir in the remaining flour mixture with a spoon until you can't see any powder.<br>
          7. Scoop/spoon into a bowl of sugar, roll them around until they're coated, then put them on a parchment paper
          lined baking sheet. You can skip this step if you're lazy.<br>
          8. Bake at 350 degrees for 12 - 14 minutes, should be light brown and "puffed". Don't overbake if you want
          them chewy.<br>
          9. Transfer to cooling rack after 2 minutes.<br>

          These are your classic chewy chocolate chip cookies, just with a little extra flavor.<br>
          Makes about 2 1/2 dozen 3" cookies.<br>
          <br>
          Ingredients:<br>
          2 1/4 cup flour<br>
          1 tsp baking soda<br>
          1/2 tsp salt<br>
          1 cup butter<br>
          3/4 cup sugar<br>
          3/4 cup brown sugar<br>
          2 eggs<br>
          1 tsp vanilla<br>
          2 cups chocolate chips<br>
          <br>
          Recommended:<br>
          1 tsp instant coffee/espresso powder - enhances the chocolate taste. Add with the sugar.<br>
          1 cup nuts - walnuts, pecans, cashews, maybe even peanuts. Adds some nice texture. variation. Add with the
          chocolate chips.<br>
          <br>
          Optional:<br>
          2 tsp cornstarch - makes the texture a bit softer? Add with the dry ingredients<br>
          1 tbsp molasses or honey - For a bit more flavor. Add with the sugar.<br>
          1/4 cup molasses + 1/2 tsp cinnamon + 1/2 tsp ginger + 1/4 tsp nutmeg + 1/4 tsp cloves. Replace sugar with
          brown sugar. This will get you a lot more molasses flavor.<br>
          Sugar balance - use 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, or just all brown sugar for different flavors.<br>
          Double vanilla - Try 2 tsp of vanilla for a bit more of that vanilla taste.<br>
          One egg - Use just 1 egg instead for a bit of a different texture.<br>
          Chocolate Chip Replacements/Additions - butterscotch, M&Ms, or other morsels can give you some big variations
          over the default.<br>
          1/2 cup malted milk/ovaltine - Makes them taste more malty. Can even add crushed malted milk balls along with
          the chocolate chips.<br>
          Reduce sugar to 1/2 cup for thicker cookies.<br>
          1/4 cup (or more) peanut butter - for a slight pb flavor.<br>

          <br>
          Steps:<br>
          <ol>
            <li>Mix melted butter and sugars until smooth</li>
            <li>Add in the eggs and vanilla, mix</li>
            <li>Add in the flour, baking soda, instant coffee, and salt. You're supposed to premix all of these in a
              separate bowl but thats more dishes to do, so I just sprinkle them evenly across my main mixing bowl, then
              mix just until there's no more powder to pick up.</li>
            <li>Add chocolate chips and nuts, mix</li>
            <li>Drop by 2-3 tablespoon scoops onto a parchment paper lined pan.</li>
            <li>Bake at 375 degrees for 8 - 10 minutes, until the edges are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer to cooling rack.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>I've made these peanut butter chocolate chip cookies a few times now and with my recipe's modifacations
            they turn out really good!<br>
            They have a real nice texture throughout and big pb taste.<br>
            <br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            2 1/4 cup flour<br>
            1 tsp baking soda<br>
            1/4 tsp salt<br>
            1 cup butter<br>
            1 1/2 cup peanut butter (I use smooth but chunky's fine too)<br>
            3/4 cup brown sugar<br>
            1/2 cup sugar<br>
            2 eggs<br>
            2 tsp vanilla<br>
            1 3/4 cup chocolate chips<br>
            <br>
            Steps:<br>
            1. Mix butter and pb. (I melt the butter in the microwave)<br>
            2. Add the sugars, mix until smooth.<br>
            3. Add the eggs one at a time, mix.<br>
            4. Add vanilla, mix.<br>
            5. Add flour/soda/salt, mix but don't over mix. (I just add these all once cause I'm lazy but you're
            supposed to mix
            these together in a separate bowl)<br>
            6. Add chocolate chips, mix.<br>
            7. Bake for 10 min at 350 degrees. (I use a scooper thingy to get the consistent shape)<br>
            <br>
            Until they fully cool, the middle will be kinda gooey, I prefer them cool. Might want 12 minutes (or more)
            in the oven if you like them a bit more... done. <br>

          <p>Chili is one of my favorite foods so of course I have a personal recipe for it! I've been working on this
            for years, usually trying a bit of variation each time.<br>
            The batch pictured was mostly eaten by the time I remembered to take a pic, used stew meat, and was made
            mild.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            1 lb ground beef (or stew meat)<br>
            1 medium onion, diced<br>
            (optional) 1 lb fresh jalapenos, sliced in rings<br>
            1 can diced tomatoes<br>
            1 can stewed tomatoes<br>
            1 can kidney beans<br>
            1 can pinto beans<br>
            (optional) 1 can black beans<br>
            1 clove garlic, diced<br>
            <br>
            Spices: (rough estimates, make it your own!)<br>
            4 tbsp chili powder (I use store brand in a shaker. I don't like the kind in the packets)<br>
            1 tbsp cumin<br>
            1 tbsp mustard<br>
            1 tbsp black pepper<br>
            2 tbsp cocoa<br>
            1 tsp garlic powder<br>
            1 tsp salt<br>
            (optional) 1/2 tsp msg (sold as Accent, also in most beef stock)<br>
            1 tsp beef stock (taste before adding more salt)<br>
            1 tbsp hot sauce of your choice (or more [or less]). I like Frank's, Tapatio, Tabasco, Dave's Insanity
            Sauce, or anything from Huy Fong depending on my mood<br>
            <br>
            For less heat, omit jalapenos and hot sauce.<br>
            <br>
            Toppings: (all optional) (try all at once for Ultra Deluxe Chili)<br>
            saltines/oyster crackers<br>
            shredded cheese<br>
            sour cream<br>
            guacamole<br>
            hot sauce<br>
            raw onion, diced<br>
            <br>
            Steps:<br>
            1. Brown meat. For stew meat brown first, then add water to cover meat, then boil (with salt, pepper, bay
            leaf) for 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 hours, covered, depending on how tough it is. Boil off excess liquid.<br>
            2. Add onion, garlic, jalapenos. Cook like a minute just to get the onions started.<br>
            3. Dump in all the cans, stir. I don't drain the beans. Stir.<br>
            4. Add all the spices. Feel free to adjust/add/remove based on your tastes! Be cautious when adding
            salt/msg/beef stock so that it doesn't get too salty. Stir.<br>
            5. Simmer until onions & jalapenos are soft, ~ 1/2 - 1 hour, stirring occasionally.<br>
            6. Serve! I like to add more hot sauce to my own bowl, then a layer of cheese, then sour cream/guac on the
            side, then oyster crackers. For saltines I like to spoon the chili onto the cracker, then eat the
            cracker.<br>
            <br>
            Tastes better the next day after reheating. <br>
