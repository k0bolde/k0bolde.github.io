                    </center>
                    Probably my favorite game, I like management sims. Like an ant farm but you're helping dwarves build
                    a forttress.<br>

                    </center>
                    An early web exploration based game, feels like exploring second life or geocities.<br>

                        <h3>Second Life</h3>
                    </center>
                    Kinda like the internet but in 3d. Very fun to explore what other people have made over the
                    years. Somewhat like exploring an unknown culture. Can also make (& sell!) your own textures and
                    models.<br>
                    Has gotten a little boring for my playstyle of just exploring around, but it was a very interesting
                    while it lasted. Also fun with friends.<br>
                    Free to start but many in-game items cost real money and so does uploading your own items.<br>

                    </center>
                    A creepy card game that's hiding a bit more... The less you know going into this one the better! As
                    long as you like card games you'll have fun.<br>
                    The last part seemed a little slow paced to me but I didn't build a very good deck.<br>
                    There's a cute stoat friend.<br>

                    </center>
                    My fave FromSoftware game so far! Tons of variety, the open world helps solve a problem I had with
                    earlier souls games where I give up way to quick and want to do something else other than attempt
                    the same boss over and over. In this there are very few chokepoints where you have to fight a
                    certain boss and that's it.<br>
                    Jar people are neat and theres lots of cool monsters.<br>

                    </center>
                    A very stylish jrpg/social sim with an alright battle system. Very long, ~130 hours for my
                    playthrough. The story drags on in several parts and for especially tropey reasons. Got me
                    interested in jrpgs. Lots of interesting monster designs.<br>

            If your switch docking station usb ports aren't working try: turning off the switch all the way, removing it
            from the dock, putting it back in, wait for it to start a bit.<br>
            You don't need to pay to play free to play games online on consoles. Like you can play Fortnite without
            paying for PSN/Xbox live/Switch online.<br>
            If you can't pair your controller to your switch, try disconnecting all controllers in settings, then
            rebooting.<br>
            PS Remote Play lets you stream games from your ps4/ps5 to your phone/tablet. No need for PSN. Can wake your
            ps4 from sleep if you set it up in settings. You can either use touch controls or a ps4 controller paired to
            your phone.<br>
            Steam Link for remote playing steam games, xbox app for remote playing xbox, geforce now app for nvidia card
            owners<br>
            You can stream to twitch directly from your phone or ps4/xbox.<br>
