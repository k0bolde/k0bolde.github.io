                            <h3>Fortnite</h3>
                        </center>
                        <h1>Season 4 Chapter 1</h1>
                        I put off playing fortnite for a long time but finally thought I'd try it and other modern f2p
                        games. It turned out a lot more fun than I expected! I've mostly only played solo no build BR
                        and some custom maps. It feels a lot more casual than I was expecting and most deaths feel like
                        my fault since the time to kill is pretty high.<br>
                        I did fall for some of the furry skins after playing for a while. The battlepass is also fun to
                        unlock things often as you play, it's also easy to complete doing just weeklies and catch up xp
                        boosts. There's also usually and event or two going on with some sort of free unlock that
                        requires you to do tasks across the map. I did start playing a lot less after I completed the
                        battlepass, not sure how I feel about that.<br>
                        The game has a update every 2 weeks that adds/removes a weapon or two, or adds some event items,
                        or even changes the game rules.<br>
                        There are bots when you first start playing and I don't like the deception they go to to pretend
                        they aren't bots, with human-ish names or anon mode. There is skill based matchmaking, so when
                        you get started or if you're bad, there will be a lot more bots in each match.<br>

                        Run a restaurant as a chef, waiter, dishwasher, and more either by yourself or with a group of 4
                        (12 with a mod) local or over the internet.<br>
                        Rougelike progression overall where you unlock more main dishes, maps, selection count, and
                        items to take into new runs as you play more, then in each game between rounds you buy
                        randomized items and can rearrange. The main goal is to finish day 15, after which, when you
                        fail in the endless overtime rounds, let you start a new run with some modifiers from the
                        run.<br>
                        Modding is easy because it uses steam workshop.<br>
                        <br>
                        I think I have more fun with it in single player but multiplayer is fun too, might just be I was
                        playing with newbies haha.<br>

                        </center>
                        Kinda like the internet but in 3d. Very fun to explore what other people have made over the
                        years. Somewhat like exploring an unknown culture. Can also make (& sell!) your own textures and
                        models.<br>
                        Has gotten a little boring for my playstyle of just exploring around, but it was a very
                        interesting
                        while it lasted. Also fun with friends.<br>
                        Free to start but many in-game items cost real money and so does uploading your own items.<br>

                        My fave FromSoftware game so far! Tons of variety, the open world helps solve a problem I had
                        with
                        earlier souls games where I give up way to quick and want to do something else other than
                        attempt
                        the same boss over and over. In this there are very few chokepoints where you have to fight a
                        certain boss and that's it.<br>
                        Jar people are neat and theres lots of cool monsters.<br>

                If your switch docking station usb ports aren't working try: turning off the switch all the way,
                removing it

                You don't need to pay to play free to play games online on consoles. Like you can play Fortnite without
                paying for PSN/Xbox live/Switch online.<br>
                If you can't pair your controller to your switch, try disconnecting all controllers in settings, then
                rebooting.<br>
                PS Remote Play lets you stream games from your ps4/ps5 to your phone/tablet. No need for PSN. Can wake

                I put off getting into VR because the games didn't seem worth it. I've finally been getting into VRChat
                because I want to make 3d models for it so I finally have a reason. I've tracked down a used Vive for
                $250, lets see how it goes.<br>
                <h1>Games</h1>

                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457550/Bigscreen_Beta/">Bigscreen</a> - its surprisingly
                hard to find vr video players, this combines that with multiplayer watching things together.<br>
                <h1>Software</h1>
